## Motivation 

Sometimes you need to copy some text and paste it in a place to hold it for a moment or so and immediately after you need to copy another text, but you wanted all reachable. I wanted to use a handy text storage to come in help.  

So why not to create a quick and easy-to-use web application for that. ðŸ’¡

## Features

Save the Text app has simple UI implementation. It has an easy-to-use UX design in it for keeping previously entered text and reach them alongside to list.

It has dark mode feature for a better readability.

## Wireframe

I've created a wireframe to see the overall view of the application before development [see the wireframe](https://savethetext.app/assets/pdf/save-the-text-wireframe.pdf)

* Angular 10+ version
* PWA - Progressive Web Apps
* Tailwind CSS
